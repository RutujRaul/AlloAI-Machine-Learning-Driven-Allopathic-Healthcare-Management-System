AlloAI - Machine Learning Driven Allopathic Healthcare Management System

## Information
AlloAI is a comprehensive Allopathic Healthcare Management System that provides predictions based on symptoms and offers recommendations such as workouts, diets, medications, precautions, etc. It also includes a patient management system with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB.

## Features
1. Healthcare Prediction System: Provides predictions and suggestions based on user symptoms.
   
2. Patient Management System: Stores, updates, deletes, and retrieves patient information using MongoDB.
   
3. Hybrid Technology Stack: Combines Flask (Python) for Machine Learning and Node.js with MongoDB for data management.
   
4. User Interface: Designed using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript.
   
5. Easy Navigation: Two main options on the interface:
    
    a. Enter Healthcare Management System: Powered by a trained ML model.
   
    b. Enter Patients Management System: CRUD operations for patient records.
